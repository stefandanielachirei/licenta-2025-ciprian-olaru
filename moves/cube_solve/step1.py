  Step 1 - solves the white face

  1. Process the URF (white-green-red) corner so that it is rotated into the target 
     position (for example, into DLF with white facing down) using your rotation_mapping.
  2. For each of the remaining three corners (in order: UFL, ULB, UBR):
       a. Locate the corner by its color set.
       b. If the corner is in the bottom layer, apply extra moves (using bottom_adjustment)
          to bring it to the top; if in the top layer, use extra moves from top_adjustment.
       c. Then repeatedly apply the face move sequence ("R U R' U'") until the white sticker
          is in the target orientation (we assume white should be at index 0 for correct alignment).
       d. Finally, apply a wholeâ€“cube rotation ("y") to shift the corner into its final diagonal position.
  3. After processing all four corners, the bottom face should be white and the adjacent 
     colors correctly aligned.
