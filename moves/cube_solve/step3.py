  Step 3 - Finalizing the Cube (Step 3 of 2x2 solution)

  1. Rotate the entire cube with z2.
  2. Then check the DFR corner (using the static corner mapping) to see which sticker 
     that belongs to the down face (indices 12â€“15) is present. If it is not yellow ('D'),
     apply the face move sequence "R U R' U'" repeatedly until the DFR corner shows a yellow sticker
     in the down-face position.
  3. If the DFR corner is correctly yellow, apply a D move (rotate the down face) and then repeat
     steps 2 and 3 until the bottom is solved.
  4. Finally, check the top face. If it is not solved (all U), apply one of U, U2, or U' as a final adjustment.
